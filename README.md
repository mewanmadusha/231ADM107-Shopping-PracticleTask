# Shopping Intent Prediction

---

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning classifier to predict whether a user visiting an online shopping website will make a purchase. The classifier uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify users based on their browsing behavior, such as the number of pages visited, time spent on each page, and more.

## Features
- Load and process shopping session data from a CSV file.
- Train a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model with k=1.
- Evaluate the model using sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate).
- Display performance metrics and classification results.
